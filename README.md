# CL-Aether: practical astronomy with common lisp

This is a system that translates the equations in _Practical Astronomy with your Calculator_ by Peter Duffet-Smith into common lisp with no external dependencies. It's currently incomplete.

Please note that this system is based off equations that aren't intended for scientific-grade precision. They are practical equations as the title of the book implies, and I'm not an astronomer, so they're suitable for my purposes.
