# Clestica: practical astronomy with common lisp

This is a system that translates the equations in _Practical Astronomy with your
Calculator_ by Peter Duffet-Smith into Common Lisp.

Its one external dependency is `local-time`. This is very much a work-in-progress.

## Caveats
- The book has "practical" in the title for a reason; these equations are not
  scientific-grade accurate
- I'm not an astronomer or mathematician and have no idea what I'm doing
